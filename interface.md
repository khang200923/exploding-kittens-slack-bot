To speed things up while playing Exploding Kittens on slack, I made it so that you can use the keyboard to play the game instead of pressing buttons. This is how it works:
- You always have to send a message in the thread to do something.
- Use the following keys as a prefix:
    - `h` to look at your hand, showing the cards you have.
    - `p[card(s)]` to play a card. For example, `pa` plays an attack card, `p33` plays two Beard Cats, etc.
    - `d` to draw a card from the deck.
    - `e` to end your turn. Most of the time, you will need to draw a card before ending your turn

Cards are represented by single letters or digits:
- `x` - eXploding Kitten
- `d` - Defuse
- `a` - Attack
- `f` - Favor
- `n` - Nope
- `s` - Shuffle
- `k` - sKip
- `e` - sEe the Future
- `1` - Taco Cat
- `2` - Rainbow Ralphing Cat
- `3` - Beard Cat
- `4` - Hairy Potato Cat
- `5` - Cattermelon
You don't need to remember these, as they will be shown to you when you look at your hand with `h`.

Sometimes, you will need to e.g. specify which player you want to play a Favor card on, or which card you want to steal with Three of a Kind. In these cases, the bot will request you for more information. You do not need this guide any further, as the bot will guide you through the process.
